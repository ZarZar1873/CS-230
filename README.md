Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? \n
  The Gaming Room client is a gaming company with a popular game called draw it or lose it. The client wanted to take their game and make it cross plateform to expand their customer bases and wanted a recommendation on what OS to use to create the cross platform gaming experience.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I think I used my research skills to provide a well thought out and unbiased recommendation based on the clients wants and needs.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  I personally found that the document and code development were using the same client but were unrelated to one another. While I am sure this is not the case in the real world, I was often doing one or the other and never had both open at the same time or even during the same week.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  If I could revise any part of the software design document I would revise the design constraint section. I feel that its small size indicates that there are restrictions that should be there that aren't. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I poured over the provided scenario and tried to imagine myself in their position as them and try to impliment their desires into my software design. When designing someone elses dream it is vital to consider what they want/need. The development you do may be another drop in the bucket for the number of programs youve designed, but for them it is often their dream they want to see made real. Its personal for most of them and that needs to be recognized.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I approached this software design like I would for someone without coding experience. I ensured the notes I left gave detailed accounts of the following code, I used best practaces for naming variables as well as the design of the code, and I clearly defined the expected outcome of each function I created. In the future I would use all of these techniques to ensure easy maintinance and updating for the future developer, even if that person is myself.
